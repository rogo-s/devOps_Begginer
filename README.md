# Notes
Notes:
macOS
Create a file: nano server-stats.sh
Delete a file: rm server-stats.sh
Save and exit: Ctrl+O â€“ Enter / Exit: Ctrl+X
Check the script for invisible characters: cat -A server-stats.sh
Set file permissions: chmod +x server-stats.sh
Execute the script: ./server-stats.sh
Debugging to see execution steps: bash -x ./server-stats.sh
Linux
Create a file: notepad server-stats.ps1
Check the file in the current directory: Get-ChildItem *.ps1
Set script permissions for execution: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
Run the script: .\server-stats.ps1
Comparison Between Linux & macOS
Both scripts are designed to display server performance statistics but differ significantly in their implementation, as they are written for different operating systems with distinct tools and syntax. Below is a comparison:

1. Target Platform
Bash Script

Written for Unix/Linux-based systems or macOS.
Uses tools like top, vm_stat, df, and ps.
PowerShell Script

Written for Windows operating systems.
Utilizes modules like Get-WmiObject, Get-CimInstance, and Get-Process.
2. Information Displayed
Total CPU Usage

Bash Script

Uses top to display detailed metrics such as user, system, and idle CPU usage.
PowerShell Script

Provides only the average processor load percentage using Get-WmiObject.
Total Memory Usage

Bash Script

Calculates active, free, and total memory from vm_stat output and factors in page size.
PowerShell Script

Uses Get-CimInstance to fetch total and free memory information, then calculates used memory.
Disk Usage

Bash Script

Uses df to show disk usage for the root directory (/) only.
PowerShell Script

Leverages Get-PSDrive to check all drives on the system and displays usage for each drive.
Top Processes by CPU Usage

Bash Script

Uses ps and sort to list processes with the highest CPU usage and formats the output with awk.
PowerShell Script

Utilizes Get-Process to sort and display processes by CPU usage.
Top Processes by Memory Usage

Bash Script

Similar to CPU usage, ps is used to sort processes by memory usage.
PowerShell Script

Uses Get-Process to select processes with the highest memory usage.
3. Output Format
Bash Script

Produces simpler output formatted with awk.
Contains a bug where some table headers are repeated (e.g., "USER PID %CPU %MEM COMMAND").
PowerShell Script

Generates more structured and visually appealing output using Format-Table.
4. Compatibility and Tool Availability
Bash Script

Relies on standard Unix/Linux tools like vm_stat and ps, which may vary in syntax or availability across distributions.
PowerShell Script

Depends on built-in PowerShell modules available on most modern Windows systems.
5. Bugs or Limitations
Bash Script

Table headers for processes are repeated unnecessarily.
Long process names are truncated due to inflexible column formatting in awk.
PowerShell Script
Decimal precision for memory usage (e.g., "7541.96 MB") could be rounded for clarity.
Does not provide detailed CPU usage breakdowns like user, system, or idle.
